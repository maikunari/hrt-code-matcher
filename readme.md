- The script auto-detects `.local` domains
- SSL verification is automatically disabled for local development

**404 Not Found:**
- Check WordPress permalinks (Settings ‚Üí Permalinks)
- Should not be set to "Plain"
- Try "Post name" structure

### Classification Issues

**Low Confidence Scores:**
- Add more detailed product descriptions
- Include material composition in product attributes
- Specify product purpose/use clearly

**Wrong Classifications:**
- Export to CSV and manually correct
- Update product descriptions for clarity
- Consider adding product attributes

## üîß Advanced Configuration

### Adjust Processing Settings

In `.env` file:

```env
BATCH_SIZE=10              # Products per batch (10-20 recommended)
AUTO_APPROVE_THRESHOLD=0.85  # Auto-approve if confidence >= 85%
RATE_LIMIT_DELAY=1.0       # Seconds between API calls
```

### Category Presets

Save frequently used category selections in `selected_categories.json` for quick reuse.

## üìù Best Practices

1. **Start Small**: Test with 10-100 products first
2. **Review Categories**: Exclude non-physical products
3. **Check Classifications**: Review the CSV export before pushing to WooCommerce
4. **Keep Descriptions Updated**: Better product descriptions = better classifications
5. **Save Your Work**: Export CSVs regularly for backup
6. **Monitor Costs**: Use option 10 to estimate costs before large batches
